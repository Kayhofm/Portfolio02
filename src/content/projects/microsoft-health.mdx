    ### The Challenge

    Disengaged patients have worse outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Our challenge: How can we help people stay engaged and follow through on care?  

    I focused on behavior change through design across mobile, web, and wearables. I led a team of 20+ designers, prototypers, and researchers. We worked closely with CVP-level leaders to define strategy and execute innovation.

    - **Problem:** Low retention post-onboarding  
    - **Root Cause:** Overemphasis on raw metrics created negative experiences  
    - **Goal:** Evolve from a tracking tool to a sustainable behavior change platform

   ### Strategic Insight: Wellness vs Metrics

    In a space defined by complexity, I built a dedicated innovation team and introduced a flexible ideation process to drive rapid experimentation, both internally and with external partners.

    Our user research showed that raw numbers created anxiety and disengagement. Users responded far better to positive reinforcement and progress narratives.

    - **Insight:** Wellness habits engage more than numeric performance  
    - **Solution:** Reframe the product around habit-building, not just metrics

   ### Behavioral Mechanisms

    We grounded the experience in behavioral science:

    - **Loss Aversion:** Users protect progress streaks  
    - **Social Proof:** Peer comparisons build motivation  
    - **Goal Gradient:** Users engage more near progress milestones  
    - **Positive Reinforcement:** Small wins, not perfection, drive momentum

   ### Research-Driven Approach

    I turned our team into a bridge between Microsoft Research and product teams. With an 800-person beta pool, we tested and refined real-world solutions:

    - **Habit Prediction Models:** ML to anticipate metrics  
    - **Activity Maximization System:** Personalized prompts via AI  
    - **Sleep Improvement Systems:** Millions of events to optimize rest  
    - **Behavior Change Study:** Field research to validate our approach  

    These studies influenced roadmap decisions and powered product innovation.
