## Engaging Healthcare

  <div>
    Engaging patients is one of the most challenging problems in healthcare.
    Disengagement leads to significantly worse health outcomes and increased costs.
    How can we encourage people to stay consistently involved in their health?
    How can we support adherence to prescribed remedies?

    My work in this area focused on motivation and behavior change, designing solutions across mobile, web,
    and wearables such as the Apple Watch and Microsoft Band.
    I managed a team of 20+, including interaction designers, visual designers, prototypers, and user researchers.
    Together, we crafted user experiences aimed at engaging users and improving health outcomes.
    I collaborated with leadership, up to the Corporate Vice President level, to drive the design and innovation process.

    Unlocking innovation in the complex and ambiguous space of healthcare solutions was central to our team's success.
    To achieve this, I built a dedicated innovation team and established a clear,
    adaptable ideation process that could be applied both internally and with external partners.
    I prioritized flexibility, ensuring the team could rapidly respond to changes and new inputs.

    I strongly believe in evidence-based, iterative design.
    Our approach focused on creating prototypes to test with users,
    enabling us to refine solutions based on real-world feedback while fostering a mindset of adaptability and creative problem-solving within the team.

    Collaborating with Microsoft Research was a career highlight as a design manager.
    I transformed my user experience team into an innovation hub, bridging PhD researchers and product engineers.
    Together, we envisioned user experiences and leveraged an 800-person beta pool for impactful studies, including:
    - Stress Prediction Models: Machine learning models to accurately predict stress.
    - Activity Maximization System: ML-driven personalized messaging to boost daily activity.
    - Sleep Improvement Systems: Solutions enhancing sleep quality using millions of recorded events.
    - Behavior Change Study: A 4,000-participant study driving improvements in sleep and activity.

    These efforts showcased the power of integrating cutting-edge research with innovative design to deliver meaningful,
    data-driven user experiences.
