### The Challenge

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
    Address low user retention by increasing value and engagement
    - Problem: Users abandoned the platform after initial novelty
    - Root cause: Focus on raw metrics created negative user experiences
    - Goal: Transform from tracking tool into sustainable behavior change platform

### Strategic Insight: Wellness vs Metrics

<ImageGallery>

  <div>
    - Problem: Raw data overwhelmed users and created negative feedback loops
    - Insight: People respond better to positive progress narratives than numerical performance
    - Solution: Reframed from "tracking metrics" to "building wellness habits

### Behavioral Mechanisms

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
    - Loss Aversion: Streaks harder to break than start
    - Social Proof: Anonymous peer comparisons
    - Goal Gradient: Progress toward achievable micro-goals
    - Positive Reinforcement: Celebrate small wins over perfectionist metrics
  </div>

## Engaging Healthcare

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
    Engaging patients is one of the most challenging problems in healthcare.
    Disengagement leads to significantly worse health outcomes and increased costs.
    How can we encourage people to stay consistently involved in their health?
    How can we support adherence to prescribed remedies?

    My work in this area focused on motivation and behavior change, designing solutions across mobile, web,
    and wearables such as the Apple Watch and Microsoft Band.
    I managed a team of 20+, including interaction designers, visual designers, prototypers, and user researchers.
    Together, we crafted user experiences aimed at engaging users and improving health outcomes.
    I collaborated with leadership, up to the Corporate Vice President level, to drive the design and innovation process.

## Design innovation team

  <div>
    Unlocking innovation in the complex and ambiguous space of healthcare solutions was central to our team's success.
    To achieve this, I built a dedicated innovation team and established a clear,
    adaptable ideation process that could be applied both internally and with external partners.
    I prioritized flexibility, ensuring the team could rapidly respond to changes and new inputs.

    I strongly believe in evidence-based, iterative design.
    Our approach focused on creating prototypes to test with users,
    enabling us to refine solutions based on real-world feedback while fostering a mindset of adaptability and creative problem-solving within the team.

## Collaboration with research

  <div>
    Collaborating with Microsoft Research was a career highlight as a design manager.
    I transformed my user experience team into an innovation hub, bridging PhD researchers and product engineers.
    Together, we envisioned user experiences and leveraged an 800-person beta pool for impactful studies, including:
    - Stress Prediction Models: Machine learning models to accurately predict stress.
    - Activity Maximization System: ML-driven personalized messaging to boost daily activity.
    - Sleep Improvement Systems: Solutions enhancing sleep quality using millions of recorded events.
    - Behavior Change Study: A 4,000-participant study driving improvements in sleep and activity.

    These efforts showcased the power of integrating cutting-edge research with innovative design to deliver meaningful,
    data-driven user experiences.
