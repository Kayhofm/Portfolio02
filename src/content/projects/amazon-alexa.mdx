## Building Market-Leading Experiences

    ### Challenge

    How do we define the right use cases for a new product category?

    - No existing user behaviors to reference for voice-first devices
    - Need to identify high-value scenarios that justify adoption
    - Balance technical constraints with user needs
    - Create focused launch strategy from infinite possibilities

  <div>
    ### Strategic Approach

    - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partnered with CEO, engineering, and product teams to align on strategic design decisions
    - User-Centered Prioritization: focus group sessions and alpha pool
    - Rapid prototyping: Developed new fast design prototyping methods that delivered high fidelity artifacts
    - Technical Feasibility Assessment: Used Agile methods to collaborate with engineering and validate design feasibility before full implementation

    ### User Research

    - Conducted focus groups discussing potential product configurations and use
    - Set up internal Alpha pool to evaluate usage of alpha-released features
    - Conducted 400-participant needs and habits survey
    - Collected feedback from usability studies

    **Key Findings**
    - A limited set of high value use cases emerged
    - Users preferred kitchen related use cases
    - Users preferred use cases that could be completed with a single command

  <div>
    ### Solution

    Use Case Framework:
    - Created systematic framework mapping technical capabilities to user needs
    - Defined 3 core categories: Entertainment, Utilities, Knowledge
    - Prioritized kitchen/living room contexts based on user research
    - Selected launch use cases: Music, Weather, News, Shopping Lists, Timers & Alarms, Q&A

    ### Impact

    - Influenced Bezos, who wanted full assistant, with data-driven storytelling to launch with high value well-crafted subset first
    - Prioritized engineering Agile backlog based on use case prioritization
    - Enabled successful launch with adoption of 10x forecast (1M in Y1)
    - Impacted Platform Strategy for category; 10+ years later, still top use cases for Alexa (pre-Alexa+)

## A novel product category

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
    Being part of the cutting-edge Alexa team, collaborating with speech scientists and engineers to define a new consumer product category, 
    aligned perfectly with my background in innovation and interaction design. 
    My responsibilities included establishing a design and user research team and defining the overall user experience. 
    Additionally, I played a key role in shaping the feature set and marketing strategy.

    I began by developing a structured design process to guide the teamâ€™s thinking, directed user research to inform key decisions,
    and led the creation of iterative prototypes to evaluate targeted experiences both internally and with a beta pool of users.
    I had the privilege of regularly presenting and discussing the envisioned user experience with leadership, including at the CEO level,
    to align on the product vision and strategy.

## A new voice user interface

<ImageGallery>
  <MDXImage src="/images/Alexadialogflow2_sq.png" />

  <div>
    The Alexa user experience team I led was tasked with creating an entirely
    new type of user interface: a pure voice interaction system for a hands-free
    device featuring only twelve full-color LED lights. During the prototyping
    and development phase, I collaborated closely with multiple teams of speech
    scientists to define the voice design, refine voice interactions, and
    establish guiding principles for automated speech recognition (ASR) and
    natural language understanding (NLU).
  </div>

## A multi-disciplinary team

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
    The Alexa team operated in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. 
    While defining key aspects of the user experience, I built a highly skilled team of 20+, including interaction designers, 
    voice interface designers, graphic designers, user researchers, and a sound designer. 
    Through a deliberate and strategic recruiting process, 
    I assembled a talented team that thrived in this high-energy, innovative setting.

## Design Explorations

        muted={true}
    />

  <div>
    Working in the emerging medium of voice, we developed tools to create realistic design explorations. 
    One key example was video sketches, which were created before the relevant Alexa services were live. 
    These sketches enabled us to explore design opportunities and provide clear guidance to the engineering team. 
    By leveraging these videos, we successfully proposed features and secured alignment within the team.
