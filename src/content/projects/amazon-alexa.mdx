## A novel product category

    Being part of the cutting-edge Alexa team, collaborating with speech scientists and engineers to define a new consumer product category, 
    aligned perfectly with my background in innovation and interaction design. 
    My responsibilities included establishing a design and user research team and defining the overall user experience. 
    Additionally, I played a key role in shaping the feature set and marketing strategy.

    I began by developing a structured design process to guide the team’s thinking, directed user research to inform key decisions,
    and led the creation of iterative prototypes to evaluate targeted experiences both internally and with a beta pool of users.
    I had the privilege of regularly presenting and discussing the envisioned user experience with leadership, including at the CEO level,
    to align on the product vision and strategy.

## A new voice user interface

  <div>
    The Alexa user experience team I led was tasked with creating an entirely
    new type of user interface: a pure voice interaction system for a hands-free
    device featuring only twelve full-color LED lights. During the prototyping
    and development phase, I collaborated closely with multiple teams of speech
    scientists to define the voice design, refine voice interactions, and
    establish guiding principles for automated speech recognition (ASR) and
    natural language understanding (NLU).

## A multi-disciplinary team

  <div>
    The Alexa team operated in a dynamic, fast-paced environment. 
    While defining key aspects of the user experience, I built a highly skilled team of 20+, including interaction designers, 
    voice interface designers, graphic designers, user researchers, and a sound designer. 
    Through a deliberate and strategic recruiting process, 
    I assembled a talented team that thrived in this high-energy, innovative setting.

  <div>
    Working in the emerging medium of voice, we developed tools to create realistic design explorations. 
    One key example was video sketches, which were created before the relevant Alexa services were live. 
    These sketches enabled us to explore design opportunities and provide clear guidance to the engineering team. 
    By leveraging these videos, we successfully proposed features and secured alignment within the team.
