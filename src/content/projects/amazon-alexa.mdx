## Defining the User Experience for a New Product Category

<ImageGallery>
  <div>
  <br />
    - **Role:** Senior Design Manager, hands-on design leadership
    - **Goal:** Define product strategy and user experience to establish new product category
    - **Stakeholders:** CEO, Head of Devices, VP Head of Alexa, PM Director, Eng Director, ASR/NLU/TTS/App teams, Marketing, ID, Partner App teams

    Being part of the cutting-edge Alexa team, collaborating with speech scientists and engineers to define a new consumer product category, 
    aligned perfectly with my background in innovation and interaction design. 
    My responsibilities included establishing a design and user research team and defining the overall user experience. 
    Additionally, I played a key role in shaping the feature set and marketing strategy.
  </div>
  <div>
    ### Impact

    - Built foundational design organization and scalable processes across product design specialties, establishing framework for large-scale design operations
    - Directed design strategy for multimodal voice interaction model and customer experiences, collaborating with CEO leadership to deliver market-leading product, exceeding forecast by 6x
    - Sold 10x forecast in first year (1M vs 100k forecasted)
    - Developed design systems and frameworks scaling to 600M devices
    - 4.4 star average rating (above industry standard)

  <div>

    ### Challenge

    How do we define the right use cases for a new product category?

    - No existing user behaviors to reference for voice-first devices
    - Need to identify high-value scenarios that justify adoption
    - Balance technical constraints with user needs
    - Create focused launch strategy from infinite possibilities

  <div>
    ### Strategic Approach

   I developed a structured design process to guide the team’s thinking, directed user research to inform key decisions,
    and led creation of iterative prototypes to evaluate targeted experiences internally and with a beta user pool.
    I regularly discussed the envisioned user experience with leadership
    to align on the product vision and strategy.

    - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partnered with CEO Jeff Bezos, engineering, and product teams to align on strategic design decisions
    - User-Centered Prioritization: focus group sessions and alpha pool
    - Rapid prototyping: Developed new fast design prototyping methods that delivered high fidelity artifacts
    - Technical Feasibility Assessment: Used Agile methods to collaborate with engineering and validate design feasibility before full implementation

    ### User Research

    Working in the emerging medium of voice, we developed tools to create realistic design explorations. 
    One key example was video sketches, which were created before the relevant Alexa services were live. 
    These sketches enabled us to explore design opportunities and provide clear guidance to the engineering team. 
    By leveraging these videos, we successfully proposed features and secured alignment within the team.

    - Conducted focus groups discussing product configurations and use
    - Set up internal Alpha pool to evaluate usage of alpha-released features
    - Conducted 400-participant needs and habits survey
    - Collected feedback from usability studies

    **Key Findings**
    - A limited set of high value use cases emerged
    - Users preferred kitchen related use cases
    - Users preferred use cases that could be completed with a single command

## 3. Voice User Interface

<ImageGallery>
  <div>

    ### Challenge

    The Alexa UX team I led was tasked with creating a
    new type of user interface: a voice interaction system for a hands-free
    device. During the prototyping
    and development phase, I collaborated closely with multiple teams of speech
    scientists to define the voice design, refine voice interactions, and
    establish guiding principles for automated speech recognition (ASR) and
    natural language understanding (NLU).

    Designing conversation for voice-first interaction
    - Create natural dialogue patterns for ambiguous voice requests
    - Balance user efficiency with accuracy when Alexa isn't sure
    - Handle technical limitations while maintaining conversational feel
    - Scale conversation design across diverse use cases

</ImageGallery>

<ImageGallery>
  <div>

    ### Strategic Approach

    - User Research & Validation: Conducted alpha user studies to validate product-market fit and interaction patterns
    - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partnered with CEO, PM, and eng on strategic design decisions
    - Design Principles: Established interaction tenets focused on conversational efficiency and contextual intelligence
    - Iterative Refinement: Used Weekly Business Reviews and user feedback to optimize pre-launch experience

  </div>

  <div className="border border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6 text-sm">
  **VUI Tenets**
    1.	We will encourage customers to use clear and conventional language to express their intents, to enable more successful interactions.
    2.	Alexa will be biased towards completing a task without asking for more information.
    3.	Alexa will ask questions in a manner that guides the customer’s request to completion.
    4.	Alexa remembers the context of a conversation.
    5.	When Alexa is wrong, the user will be able to easily and quickly correct her.
    6.	Strengths of the GUI complement the limitations in the VUI experience.
  </div>

  <div>

    ### Research Findings

    User Conversation Preferences:
    - Short, confirmatory conversations emerged as optimal interaction model
    - Users prefer slot-specific questions to intent-related questions
    - Users don’t mind an extra conversation turn to get the right result

    Quote: "I like when she confirms her understanding, rather than doing something and me having to correct"
