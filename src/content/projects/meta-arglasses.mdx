# Creating a new input system

    <div>
        Since AR glasses lack a physical surface for interaction, we needed to invent new ways for users to engage with content.
        Drawing on my prior experience with input design before working on Orion, I established an input team to develop prototypes and evaluate them through user research. Our initial explorations focused on hand tracking, including direct manipulation, pointing, and virtual keyboards. While hands proved to be a compelling input method, we expanded our exploration to include innovative approaches such as the EMG wristband and eye gaze tracking.
        After numerous iterations refining the EMG and gaze models, we ultimately identified a combination of the wristband and gaze tracking as the primary input method for Orion.

# Exploring AR experiences

The majority of my work on Orion focused on defining the experiences that formed the foundation of its user value.
My team explored a broad range of possibilities, including communications, contextual applications, virtual objects, and more.
We produced experience videos to guide technology development and gather user feedback. For deeper evaluation, we developed fully interactive prototypes using proprietary headsets.
Our designs spanned from AR adaptations of existing Meta apps to entirely new methods of communication, digital content consumption, and interaction with the world.

    # Design for AR

    One of the key challenges for the Orion glasses was developing design tools for creating digital 3D artifacts in physical space.
    We explored a wide range of concepts using methods that spanned from quick sketches to fully interactive prototypes.
    Quick video sketches, like those shown on the right, proved especially effective.
    These concepts highlight spatial communication and guided instructions, offering a glimpse into the transformative potential of AR.
