## Laying the Foundation for AR Glasses

As Platform Director at Meta Reality Labs Research, I led the design vision for future AR input systems, shaping the foundational human-computer interaction paradigms for Metaâ€™s next-generation AR glasses.

- Defined multimodal interaction language and input system strategy, resulting in critically acclaimed EMG- and eye-tracking-based experiences  
- Built and scaled design teams within the research organization, embedding design in early-stage innovation and platform strategy  
- Directed cross-functional efforts to shape AR use cases, aligning design, engineering, and research to define user value and product viability
