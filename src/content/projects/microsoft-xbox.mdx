    I developed an interaction language for Xbox Kinect, combining 3D gestures based on skeletal recognition with voice interactions supported by audio and visual feedback. 
    Leading a team of designers and animators, I collaborated closely with user research, prototyping, and engineering teams to explore possibilities and define optimal interactions. 
    A particularly interesting challenge was determining when to prioritize different input and output methods and how to integrate these interaction mechanisms seamlessly for a cohesive user experience.
