    ### Contextual AI
    Combining AI with sensors on glasses creates a powerful platform for delivering compelling user experiences. 
    As a manager and design lead, I led teams in developing numerous prototypes, defining the scenarios, interactions, 
    and visual designs to showcase these capabilities.

    In this example on Orion, AI utilizes object recognition and location data, 
    employing world-locking to seamlessly position UI elements within the environment. 
    The scenario demonstrates how AI recognizes food items and suggests a recipe in real time.

  ### Meta AI
  We took the first steps in integrating AI into glasses experiences, 
  enabling on-the-go functionality powered by input from the point-of-view camera. 
  
  As the design lead, I played a key role in crafting the experience for Meta AI on Orion.

  - Delivered under short turnaround timelines
  - Drove intense collaboration with engineering teams
  - Aligned closely with Meta AI to integrate platform capabilities
  - Designed and shipped new interaction patterns

    ### Generative UX
    In the near future, AI will dynamically generate interfaces by leveraging app services, functioning as an intelligent agent.
    These UIs will be tailored to individual needs, preferences, and environments, offering a personalized, customized, and contextualized experience.

    To illustrate this to leadership and engineering, I developed a
    Node.js/React prototype that renders live UI by integrating service
    APIs to fetch content. This image of the prototype shows step-by-step
    instructions entirely generated by AI, which autonomously determined text
    treatments, image placement, and column layout. The
    prototype supports various components, such as lists,
    buttons, and maps, showcasing the potential for versatile, AI-driven UI
    generation.

    - Developed prototype
    - Initiated large initiative
    - Presented at conference
