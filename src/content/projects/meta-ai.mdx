# Generative UX

- Developed prototype
- Initiated large initiative
- Presented at conference

I believe that in the near future, AI will dynamically generate user interfaces by leveraging app services and functioning as an intelligent agent.
These interfaces will be tailored to individual needs, preferences, and environments, offering a personalized, customized, and contextualized experience.

    To illustrate this capability to leadership and engineering, I developed a
    Node.js/React prototype that renders live UI by integrating multiple service
    APIs to fetch content. This image of the prototype demonstrates step-by-step
    instructions entirely generated by AI, which autonomously determined text
    treatments, the placement and timing of images, and the column layout. The
    prototype also supports various formats and elements, such as lists,
    buttons, and maps, showcasing the potential for versatile, AI-driven UI
    generation.

# Contextual AI

Combining AI with sensors on glasses creates a powerful platform for delivering compelling user experiences. As a manager and design lead, I led teams in developing numerous prototypes, defining the scenarios, interactions, and visual designs to showcase these capabilities.

In this example on Orion, AI utilizes object recognition and location data, employing world-locking to seamlessly position UI elements within the environment. The scenario demonstrates how AI recognizes food items and suggests a recipe in real time.

# Meta AI

Meta AI has taken its first steps in integrating AI into glasses experiences, enabling on-the-go functionality powered by input from the point-of-view camera. As the design lead, I played a key role in crafting the experience for Meta AI on Orion. Additionally, I led the design for innovative AI use cases for the successors to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
