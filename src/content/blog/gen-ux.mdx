Iâ€™ve been experimenting with an AI prototype that generates UX in real-timeâ€”not just content, but the entire interface itself. This isnâ€™t just about automation; itâ€™s about a fundamental shift in how we design digital experiences.

Right now, UX design is deterministicâ€”we create fixed layouts that every user sees, whether or not they fit their needs. But what if AI could dynamically generate a UI tailored to each person, in every moment, based on their context and intent?

âœ¨ Imagine a world whereâ€¦  
âœ… Your UI adapts on demandâ€”no more lowest-common-denominator designs  
âœ… AI dynamically builds interfaces that fit your unique needs & workflows  
âœ… Services seamlessly integrate into agentic, app-less experiences

This is the potential of Generative UXâ€”where AI isnâ€™t just filling templates or creating offline designs but creating personalized, contextual, and agentic experiences in real time.
