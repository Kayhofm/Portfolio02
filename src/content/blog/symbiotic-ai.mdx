In the summer of 2025 I had the opportunity to present at World Summit AI on a topic that’s close to my heart:

**The Body Is the Interface – Symbiotic AI for the Physical World**

As AI moves off the screen and into our physical environments, it begins living on our bodies, learning from our behavior, and responding to our surroundings.

We’re no longer just designing tools—we’re shaping relationships.

In this short talk, I share what we learned from designing Alexa, Orion, and Ray-Ban Meta—and how those experiences revealed the limitations of ambient interfaces and the potential of embodied, generative, and symbiotic AI.

I cover:
- The 9 qualities of Symbiotic AI
- Design principles for trust, restraint, and calm
- Why just-in-time UX must be embodied and contextual
